00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:07,860
It's been my dream to
work here at Sangyo Chuo Bank.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:08,700
(半沢)この産業中央銀行で
働くことは 私の夢でした

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,340
≪(面接官)いや しかし銀行は
うちだけじゃないでしょう

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,840
However, we're not
the only bank around, are we?

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,840
No, but

6
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,340
いいえ

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,440
it has to be this bank.

8
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,940
こちらでなければダメなんです

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,850
My family runs a small business.

10
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,350
実家が
小さな会社をやっております

11
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,180
When I was in middle school, 

12
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,680
私が中学のとき

13
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,500
our client company went bankrupt, and

14
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,000
取引先が倒産して

15
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,190
my family's company was
on the verge of bankruptcy too.

16
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,690
うちの会社も つぶれる寸前まで
追い詰められました

17
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,580
The scene of my father begging and pleading, 

18
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:35,360
何とかします 何とかしますと

19
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,360
saying, "I'll figure out a way, I'll figure out a way, "

20
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,030
そう言って
必死に頭を下げる父の姿は

21
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,530
is still etched in my mind.

22
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,030
今でも目に焼き付いております

23
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,850
A few days later, 

24
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,350
その数日後

25
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,650
my father collapsed from exhaustion
and passed away.

26
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,150
父は過労で倒れ 他界しました

27
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,000
After my father's death, 
our local main bank

28
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,600
父の死後
メインバンクだった地元の地銀は

29
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,120
wasted no time withdrawing their loan, and

30
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,030
いち早く融資を引き揚げ

31
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,500
tormented my mother and employees.

32
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,000
母と従業員を苦しめました

33
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,460
At that time, the one who saved us

34
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,190
そのとき
私達を救ってくださったのは

35
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,300
was the bank with whom
we only had a casual business relationship, 

36
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:08,030
それまで つきあい程度しか
取り引きをしていなかった

37
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,530
the Sangyo Chuo Bank.

38
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,030
こちらの産業中央銀行です

39
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:16,900
Your bank foresaw the potential
of my father's industrial parts

40

御行は 父が残した工業用部品の
将来性を正確に見抜き

41
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,860
and saved us by giving us a loan.

42
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:20,360
融資して救ってくださいました

43
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,560
My mother took over my father's factory, and

44
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,190
父の工場は 母が引き継ぎ

45
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,980
she has been managing to keep it
in operation to this day.

46
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,680
今でも どうにか続けていくことが
できております

47
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:30,120
That is the reason I want to join your bank

48
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:31,780
ですから私は
ぜひとも御行に入って

49
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,880
and repay that debt.

50
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,380
その恩返しがしたいと
思っております

00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,840

Most of the work is

ほとんどが手作業ですね

Once we get a big order, we'll
put some of it on the assembly line.

量産が決まれば
ある程度はラインに乗せます

But if you're making each one
meticulously by hand,

しかし こうチマチマと
いちいち手作業で行うとなると

hearing the sound is what's important.

Is this a titanium engine valve?

ただ一つ 条件があります

259
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,400
This patent is much too lax.

この特許は甘すぎる

261
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,360
The substance nomenclature
and use are too restrictive.

262
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,350
物質名と使用用途が
固定しすぎています

263
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:59,600
With a minor change, 
the same effect can be easily stolen.

264
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:00,530
これでは少し変更を加えただけで
同じような効果を簡単に盗まれる

to make this last push.

312
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,020
だからこそ あとひと息
君の力を貸してもらいたい➡

313
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,380
If we can reach
the sales target of 10 billion yen, 

314
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,000
融資実行額100億円を達成すれば

315
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,170
our Osaka Nishi Branch will be sure to capture

316
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,670
我が大阪西支店は 名誉ある

317
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:25,840
the prestigious crown as the Best Branch.

318
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:26,340
最優良店舗の栄冠を
獲得することは間違いない

319
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,180
We can then live up to our reputation
as the top branch in Kansai.

320
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:30,680
そうなれば 関西で名実ともに
トップ店舗になれます➡

321
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:34,190
It will have a great impact on the assessment
of all the employees working here as well.

322
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,690
ここで働く全行員の査定にも
大きく影響するでしょう➡

323
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:39,310
In order to do that, we need
another 500 million in sales.

324
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:39,810
そのためにも 何としても
あと５億の実行が必要です

325
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,310
Am I wrong?

326
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,810
違いますか？

西大阪スチールに

329
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:49,620
just happens to have a need for
a large amount of cash.

330
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:50,230
ちょうど まとまった資金需要が
あるそうです➡

331
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,040
Go talk to them and finalize the deal.

332
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:53,000
伺って 話を詰めてきてください

333
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,360
Did you actually see President Higashida?

334
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,410
(角田)あの 東田社長に
お会いになられたんですか？

335
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,720
- Yes.
- No matter how many times

336
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,460
はい
いや あの社長は

337
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,680
何度訪問しても
会ってさえいただけなかったので

338
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,600
- we went, he wouldn't see us.
- Is that right?

339
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,940
- That wasn't the case with me.
- Manager.

340
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,850
そうですか？
そんなことはなかったですよ

341
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,720
Forgive me for underestimating your abilities.

342
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,500
ご手腕 おみそれいたしました

343
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:11,140
I think we can put
Nakanishi-kun in charge now.

344
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,940
担当者は
そろそろ中西君でもいいでしょう

345
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,840
(中西)えッ？

346
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,620
Manager, 
this is only Nakanishi's second year.

347
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,760
支店長 中西は まだ２年目ですよ
少し荷が重すぎるのでは

348
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,960
- Don't you think it's too much for him?
- I don't think so.

349
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,400
そんなことはないでしょう
むしろ零細企業よりも ああいう➡

350
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,260

Well, our branch manager...uh...

00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:55,860
あの 支店長が その…

385
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,760
We heard from our Manager Asano
that you may be interested in getting a loan.

386
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:00,360
支店長の浅野から ご融資のお話を
いただいたと聞いております

387
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,500
Ah, you mean the operating capital.

388
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,000
ああ 運転資金のことか

389
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,480
He insisted so I just said I'll listen to
what you guys have to say.

390
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,690
どうしても言うから 話だけは
聞かせてもらうって言うただけ

391
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,720
I haven't decided yet.

392
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:11,010
まだ決めたわけちゃうわ
うちはこれまで

393
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:14,140
We've been dealing exclusively
with our main bank, Kansai City Bank.

394
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:14,400
メインの関西シティ銀行一本で
やってきたんや

395
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,000
If you suddenly want to do business with us, 

396
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,330
いきなり つきあってくれ言うなら

397
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,200
you gotta show me some good faith.

398
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,350
それなりの誠意は
見せてもらわんとな

399
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,880
If you don't mind, please tell us.
How much do you need?

400
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:24,510
差し支えなければ お教えください
その運転資金 おいくらくらい？

401
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:28,030
ああ
５億か６億っちゅうところかな

402
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,400
- I'd say about 500 or 600 million.
- 600 million...

403
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,340
６億…

404
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:33,140
Please, sir.
That operating capital, let us...

405
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,640
お願いいたします 社長
その資金 ぜひ当行に…

406
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,500
By all means, 
won't you let us review it?

407
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,350
ぜひ 当行で検討させて
いただけませんでしょうか

408
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,520
Did you say review?

409
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:43,020
検討だ？

410
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,860
Don't be ridiculous.

411
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,360
アホなこと言うな

412
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,960
You guys are the one who
insisted on giving me the loan.

413
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,660
どうしても融資させてくれ
言うたんは そっちやろが

414
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,180
And now you say review?

415
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,680
それを検討だ？

416
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,850
If that's the way you feel, 
I'll just take my business to Kansai City.

417
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,350
そういうことなら
関西シティに頼むまでや

418
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,840
You're okay with that, right?

419
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,340
それでいいよな？

420
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:59,020
ぜひ 検討させてください

421
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,520
Please let us review it.

422
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:02,490
≪(浅野)なぜ
取ってこなかったのですか？

423
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,560
Why didn't you get the loan?

424
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:06,640
I can't possibly see Nishi Osaka Steel's
corporate culture as that of a blue-chip firm.

425
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:06,850
西大阪ｽﾁｰﾙの社風は とても
優良企業のそれとは思えません

426
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,780
What do you mean?

427
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:08,850
というと？

428
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,060
President Higashida was
completely unapproachable until now.

429
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:12,020
これまで全く
取り付く島のなかった東田社長が

430
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,820
Isn't there a reason why
he volunteered information about

431
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,420
突然 こうも簡単に資金需要の話を
持ちかけてきたのは

432
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,120
his capital requirements all of a sudden?

433
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,340
何か理由があるから
ではないでしょうか

434
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:21,850
- Let me check this out a little further.
- There's no need for that.

435
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:22,350
もう少し調べさせてください
その必要はありません

436
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,600
Earlier, I talked to
President Higashida directly

437
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:25,370
先ほど
東田社長とは直接話して

438
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,960
and told him
we're proceeding with the loan.

439
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:27,690
融資を進めると伝えました

440
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,840
It's a 500 million, 5-year, 
fixed rate, unsecured loan.

441
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:32,340
金額は５億 借入期間は５年で
固定レート 無担保で対応

442
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:37,040
Nakanishi-kun, you're coming with me
to get the necessary paperwork.

443
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:37,030
中西君 これから先方に私と一緒に
出向いて関係書類を受け取り

444
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:40,010
明日の朝までに
稟議書を提出してください

445
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,680
Please submit the request for
approval by tomorrow morning.

446
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,740
Wait a minute.

447
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,680
えッ？
ちょっと待ってください

448
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,220
- By tomorrow morning is impossible...
- We don't have much time left.

449
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,020
さすがに明日の朝というのは…
もう時間がありません

450
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,660
Whether we can be
the best branch or not depends on

451
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,670
この融資が実行できるかどうかで

452
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:51,480
whether this loan goes through or not.

453
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:52,360
最優良店舗になれるかどうかが
決まります

454
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:57,860
This is the turning point for our branch.

455
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:58,360
ここが 我が支店にとっての
勝負どころです

456
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,500
Nakanishi, you can do it, can't you?

457
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,000
中西 やれるよな？

458
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,510
Yes...

459
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,010
はい…

460
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:10,700
ああ すぐにお車の用意を 中西

いいえ

all this time, right?

The only criteria he was lacking to be a director
was field experience.

あの人が取締役になる条件として
唯一足りなかったのが現場経験➡

岸谷証券営業部長職

914
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,540
He's getting loaned out, huh?

915
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,040
出向か

916
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,870
Loaned out sounds good, but

917
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,370
出向って言えば
聞こえはいいけどさ

918
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:42,050
要は 片道切符の島流しだよ

919
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:41,550
but in actuality, he's getting
shipped out with a one-way ticket.

920
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,420
He can never come back to the bank again.

921
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:44,650
もう二度と銀行には戻れない

922
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:49,090
If you screw up even once, 
you get shipped out right away.

923
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,590
一度でも しくじれば
すぐに飛ばされる

924
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:52,190
That's the reality of working for a bank.

925
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:52,690
それが 銀行の現実だ

926
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:56,260
Let's be careful, huh?

927
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,760
お互いさ 気をつけような

928
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,380
<２ヵ月後>

929
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,280
2 months later, 

930
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,240
what Tomari feared

931
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,050
<渡真利の その言葉は>

932
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,550
became a reality for Hanzawa.

933
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:07,050
<半沢にとって現実となった>

934
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:13,940
Negative balance? The last financial statements
forecasted a positive balance of 100 million.

935
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:14,880
赤字？ この前の試算表では１億の
黒字という予想だったはずだが

936
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,400
- How can it go red in just 2 months?
- I don't know.

937
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,050
たった２ヵ月で どうして赤字に？
分かりません

938
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:21,320
I've been trying to call Accounting Section
Chief Namino to verify, but I can't reach him.

939
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:22,470
波野経理課長に何度も確認の電話
入れてるんですが つかまらなくて

940
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,640
Credit file.

941
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,370
ｸﾚｼﾞｯﾄﾌｧｲﾙ
(中西)はい

942
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,780
Were you the one who photocopied
these financial statements?

943
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:27,380
この試算表は 君がコピーしたのか
いえ

944
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:29,420
When I asked for the financial statements, 
this is what they gave me.

945
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:30,400
決算書などを要求したら
これが準備してあって

946
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,400
Did you see the original?

947
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,470
ｵﾘｼﾞﾅﾙは見たか？
えッ？

948
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,270
- Did you see the original of these copies?
- No, I didn't.

949
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:35,770
このコピーの原本は見たか？
いえ 見てません

950
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,890
Window dressing...

951
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:40,390
粉飾…

952
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:42,410
そんな➡

953
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,200
That can't be.

954
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,900
Then, that 500-million yen loan...

955
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:44,930
じゃあ あの５億の融資は…

956
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,980
行くぞ

957
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,480
Let's go.

958
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,820
Window dressing refers to the manipulation
by a company of its financial statements

959
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:51,150
<粉飾とは
会社が嘘の決算書を作り>

960
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:54,890
to improve the appearance of
its performance or liquidity.

961
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:55,390
<あたかも利益があるように
見せかけることである>

962
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:58,500
The intent is to
raise the stock value, or

963
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,710
<その目的は株価をつり上げたり>

964
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:03,230
mislead the bank in order to borrow money
it has no way of paying back.

965
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:03,730
<銀行をだまして 返すあてのない
資金を借りるためである>

966
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,640
Oh please, what window dressing?

967
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:06,380
やめてくださいよ 粉飾だなんて

968
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:09,440
Then how do you explain this financial deficit?

969
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,720
では この赤字決算
どう説明していただけるんですか

970
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,040
Well...I'll have to look into it.

971
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,410
まあ それは よく調べてみないと

972
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,680
I'll look into it.

973
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:14,410
私が調べましょう

974
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,740
Please show me your general ledger.
I'll add it up.

975
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:17,540
総勘定元帳を見せてください
集計しますから

976
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:19,200
It's at our accountant's office right now.

977
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:20,230
今 税理士事務所にありまして

978
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:23,200
I see. Well then, please show me
the receipt for your corporate tax.

979
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:23,700
そうですか では
法人税の領収書を見せてください

980
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:26,570
I'd like to compare it to the copy
that was previously provided to us.

981
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:27,070
前にいただいてるコピーと
照合します

982
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:29,960
Is that at the accountant's office as well?

983
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:30,460
それも 税理士事務所ですか？

984
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:33,380
社長に会わせてください
今 外出中です

985
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,200
- Let me meet with the President.
- The President is currently out.

986
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,560
- What time will he be back?
- I'm not sure.

987
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:36,060
何時にお戻りです？
さあ 何とも

988
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,760
Nakanishi, 
bring me change of clothes from my house.

989
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:39,720
中西 俺の家から着替えを
持ってこい 会えるまで泊まり込む

990
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,360
I'm staying until I see him.

991
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,200
- That's absurd. You're distressing me!
- We're the ones who are distressed!

992
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,700
そんなアホな 困りますよ！
困るのは こっちだ！

993
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:46,800
Namino-san, you're
the Accounting Section Chief, aren't you?

994
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,720
波野さん あなた経理課長でしょう

995
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,780
何も知らないなんて話は
通りませんよ

996
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,920
Saying you don't know anything isn't going to cut it.

997
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:53,660
Is the President there?
He has a call from Iida Scrap.

998
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:53,730
社長いらっしゃいますか？
飯田ｽｸﾗｯﾌﾟさんからお電話です➡

999
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:56,720
社長 ３番に飯田社長からです

1000
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,440
President, President Iida is on line 3.

1001
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,220
Hanzawa-san!

1002
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,720
半沢さん！

1003
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:02,160
Wait a minute.
I'm telling you, the President isn't here.

1004
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,820
ちょっと待ってください 社長は
ほんまに留守なんですって

1005
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:05,210
You can't go in there like that!

1006
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,710
あの 勝手に入らないでください！
あッ…

1007
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,500
I thought you were here.

1008
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,400
やはり いらっしゃったんですね

1009
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:13,020
Seeing you guys' face makes me wanna puke.
That's why I was hiding.

1010
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:13,380
おめえらの面見てると
吐き気がするからよ 隠れてたんだ

1011
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:17,000
President, depending on
the circumstances, you may have to

1012
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:17,050
社長 場合によっては
融資した５億

1013
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:20,080
return the 500 million we loaned you.

1014
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:20,090
返していただくことになります

1015
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:22,730
おうおう おうおう おうおう

1016
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,660
Banks sure are high-handed, huh?

1017
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:25,830
横暴だよな
銀行さんっつうのはよ

1018
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:30,380
おめえらが どうしても借りてくれ
っつうから借りてやったんだぞ

1019
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:29,720
I only got the loan because you guys insisted.

1020
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:33,140
It's a different story
if window dressing was involved.

1021
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:33,380
粉飾となれば 話は別です

1022
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:39,130
仮に 仮にだぞ

1023
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,840
Supposing...supposing, mind you, 

1024
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,900
for argument's sake, 
let's say we did window dress.

1025
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:42,400
100万歩譲って
うちが粉飾したとしよう➡

1026
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,580
That would make you guys

1027
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,080
そしたらよ あんたらは

1028
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:48,220
a bunch of boneheads who couldn't

1029
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:48,720
そんなことも見抜けねえで
金を貸した

1030
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:53,520
even spot that and
loaned me the money.

1031
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:54,020
間抜けの集団っちゅうことに
なるんやぞ

1032
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,680
お引き取りください

1033
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,180
You can leave now.

1034
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,520
1 month later, 

1035
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,120
<１ヵ月後>

1036
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:07,390
Nishi Osaka Steel bounced a big check

1037
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:07,890
<西大阪スチールは
多額の不渡りを出し>

1038
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:10,910
and went bankrupt almost too easily.

1039
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:11,410
<あっけないほど簡単に倒産した>

1040
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:14,920
What are the chances of
recovering the 500 million?

1041
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:15,060
それで ５億回収の見込みは？

1042
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:18,160
会社も 東田の自宅も

1043
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,780
Both the company building
and the residence

1044
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:21,300
have Kansai City's foreclosure notice
stuck all over the place.

1045
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,800
関西シティの根抵当権が
ベッタリと張り付いています

1046
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,080
I'm not sure if there are
any other assets in reserve.

1047
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,720
他に余力となる資産が
あるかどうか

1048
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,140
What's President Higashida saying?

1049
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,060
東田社長は何と言ってる？

1050
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:29,890
Ever since his check bounced this morning, 
his whereabouts is unknown.

1051
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:30,390
今朝 不渡りを出してから
行方が分かりません

1052
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:33,680
The fact that the window dressing was
overlooked is at the root of all this.

1053
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:34,050
粉飾を見破れなかったのが
全てですね

1054
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,230
Exactly.

1055
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:36,730
≪(江島)おっしゃるとおりです

1056
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:40,200
Why couldn't you spot
a simple window dressing like that?

1057
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:40,700
あの程度の粉飾
なぜ見抜けなかったのかね？

1058
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,380
You know very well that we weren't
allowed the time to do that, Assistant Manager...

1059
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:45,060
あのとき それだけの時間が
なかったことぐらい 副支店長も…

1060
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,890
That's just an excuse!

1061
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,390
そんなのは言い訳だぞ！➡

1062
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:50,910
Do you realize?
That's 500 million. 500 million!

1063

言いなりなんて直樹らしくない

1186
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:48,040
Why did you follow such an order?
It's not like you to do whatever your boss says.

1187
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:51,630
It's a given that salarymen

If this loan was successful, I may have
had a chance to go back to Headquarters.

1190

復帰できたかもしれないんだ

はあ？

- That's not what I'm saying.

I wasn't planning to come this way, but

1209
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,440
I was a little concerned.

1210
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,410
ちょっと心配になってな

1211
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,340
- Sorry for causing you concern.
- That's okay, Don't worry about it.

1212
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:16,080
すまんな お前にまで心配かけて
いいんだよ そんなこと

1213
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:19,480
More importantly, what are the chances
of recovering the 500 million?

1214
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,400
それより どうなんだよ
５億回収の見込みは

1215
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,380
正直 まだ何も分からない状態だ

1216
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,340
To be honest, 
we still don't know anything.

1217
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:25,920
東田に取り返せるだけの
隠し財産があるのかどうか

1218
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,860
Whether Higashida has enough
hidden assets to pay us back.

1219
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,300
Even if we want to ascertain that, 
Higashida's in hiding

1220
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,070
確かめようにも
肝心の東田は雲隠れしていて

1221
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,580
and we don't even know where he is.

1222
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,640
どこにいるのかも分からない

1223
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:34,420
Did you really look for him?
I mean, seriously.

1224
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:35,390
ちゃんと捜したのかよ 本気で

1225
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:39,300
Hanzawa, look for him even
if you have to hire a detective.

1226
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:38,990
半沢 探偵を雇ってでもいいから
調べろよ

1227
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:42,490
何かあるのか？

1228
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,640
Is something going on?

1229
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:45,400
最近 お前んとこの浅野支店長➡

1230
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:45,140
Lately, your Branch Manager Asano's been

1231
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,700
in frequent contact with Headquarters.

1232
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,390
本部に
ちょくちょく連絡してきてる➡

1233
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:50,940
The other day, he even took the time
to make a one-day trip.

1234
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:51,730
この間なんて わざわざ日帰りで
足を運んできた

1235
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:53,040
Do you know why?

1236
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:54,030
何でだか分かるか？

1237
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,500
It's to lay the groundwork.

1238
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,380
根回しだよ

1239
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:01,960
Asano's claiming that you're solely
responsible for that loan blunder.

1240
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:02,720
浅野は あの融資は 全て
お前一人のミスだと主張してる

1241
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,060
いいか？ 今回の損失は

1242
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,360
Listen. The cause of this loss

1243
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:08,060
融資課長である
お前の力不足により

1244
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:08,280
lies in your incompetence as
the Loan Section Chief

1245
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:11,430
通常であれば当然
見破ることのできた粉飾を

1246
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,930
because you overlooked
the window dressing which

1247
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:13,900
naturally would've been spotted
under normal circumstances.

1248
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:14,400
見過ごしてしまったことに
原因がある

1249
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,800
That's Asano's story.

1250
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,750
それが浅野の言い分だ

1251
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,570
That's what he told Director Owada too
and he's maneuvering behind the scene.

1252
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:20,070
大和田常務にも そう言って
根回ししてるらしいよ

1253
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:25,240
I hate to say this, but right now, 
you're the lizard's tail.

1254
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:25,080
言いたかないんだけどさ
今のお前は トカゲの尻尾だよ➡

1255
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:30,380
このままじゃ
全責任を負わされて切られるぞ➡

1256
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:29,880
At this rate, they're gonna put all
the responsibility on you and cut you off.

1257
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,400
なあ 回収だよ 半沢

1258
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:32,020
You've got to recover it, Hanzawa.

1259
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:35,440
You've got to find Higashida and
do whatever it takes to

1260
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,720
何としても東田を見つけだして
どんな手を使ってでも

1261
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,870
squeeze 500 million out of him.

1262
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,370
５億 搾り取れ➡

1263
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,720
More than likely, you'll be called to
Headquarters within a week.

1264
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:42,410
恐らく １週間以内に
お前は本部に呼び出される

1265
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:45,500
They call it a hearing, 
but in reality, it's an inquiry commission.

1266
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:46,400
聞き取り調査って名目だが
実像は お前の査問委員会だ

1267
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,580
What's more, 
the members are all Asano's supporters.

1268
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,090
しかも担当は 全員
浅野の息のかかった連中だ

1269
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:54,020
They're planning to
force you to admit to the mistake and

1270
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:54,390
その場で お前自身の口から
ミスを認めさせて

1271
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,910
make you Asano's scapegoat.

1272
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:57,410
浅野の身代わりにするつもりだよ

1273
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,510
You know what lies ahead, don't you?

1274
00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:01,010
その先に何が待ってるか
分かってるよな？

1275
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,860
One way ticket to no man's land, huh?

1276
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:05,360
片道切符の島流しか

1277
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:12,070
タイムリミットは
１週間あるかないか

1278
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:11,420
The time limit is 1 week at the most.

1279
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,060
Before that, do whatever you gotta do to
scrape up 500 million!

1280
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:15,560
その前に何としてでも
５億かき集めろ！

1281
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:16,580
You got that, Hanzawa?

1282
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,610
いいな 半沢

1283
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:18,760
That's the only way...

1284
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:20,110
それしかもう お前の…

1285
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,700
I can't survive anymore.

1286
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,200
<生き残る道はない>

1287
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:31,640
So what you're saying is that the loss of
500 million yen was caused entirely by

1288
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:32,400
(大和田)つまり その半沢という
融資課長が独断で先走ったことが

1289
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:34,380
this Loan Section Chief Hanzawa who
went forward with the loan at his own discretion.

1290
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,570
５億損失の全ての原因だった
というわけですね？

1291
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:37,720
I am extremely inconvenienced by all this as well.

1292
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:38,570
私としても まったく
いい迷惑です

1293
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:40,920
I'm very sorry for causing you much worry.

1294
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:41,740
常務にも大変ご心配をおかけして
申し訳ございません

1295
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:45,240
I'm not that worried.
I took you under my wings.

1296
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:45,740
別に心配などしてませんよ
ことのほか目をかけてきた君が

1297
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:48,280
You would never make such a mistake.

1298
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:48,780
そんな失態を
犯すはずないですから

1299
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,280
I'll leave everything to you.

1300
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:51,060
あとのことは全て任せます

1301
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:54,050
Thank you.
I will deal with it immediately.

1302
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:54,550
ありがとうございます
では 早急に対処いたします

1303
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:56,740
はい あとね

1304
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,560
Also, 

1305
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,540
that Best Branch Award.

1306
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:59,740
あの最優良店舗賞

1307
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,580
Some thought it should be forfeited, but

1308
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:03,080
剥奪という意見もあったんですが

1309
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:05,880
I dodged the issue, 
so don't worry.

1310
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:06,380
うやむやにしときましたから
心配しないで

1311
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,560
Thank you again.

1312
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:10,400
重ね重ね ありがとうございます

1313
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,890
If you'll excuse me now.

1314
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,390
それでは 失礼いたします

1315
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:15,690
浅野君

1316
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,190
Asano-kun.

1317
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:20,160
Make sure...

1318
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:20,390
責任は…

1319
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,560
he takes full responsibility.

1320
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:22,900
しっかり取らせなさい

1321
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,640
Problems like this can come back to haunt you.

1322
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:26,000
こういう問題は もめますからね

1323
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,550
Yes, sir.

1324
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:30,050

00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,080
素敵なマイホームで
ああいうの

1360
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:45,660
I'm so jealous of you, Yukiko-san.

1361
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:46,160
いいなあ 由紀子さんが
うらやましい

1362
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:48,800
It's so comfy here, 
I overstayed my welcome before I knew.

1363
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,400
あんまり居心地いいから
つい長居しちゃった

1364
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,580
- If Hanzawa puts his mind to it, he could...
- No way, no way.

1365
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,420
半沢だって その気になったら…
無理 無理

1366
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:54,200
He doesn't have that kind of resourcefulness.

1367
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:55,740
あの人には そんな甲斐性ないわよ

1368
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:58,720
うちでよかったら
いつでも遊びに来てよ

1369
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,400
If you'd like, 
come visit us anytime.

1370
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:01,140
It'll keep Yukiko occupied too.

1371
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,890
由紀子も
そのほうが退屈しないでいいだろ

1372
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:04,060
(由紀子)もうビールいいの？

1373
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:03,740
Have you had enough beer already?

1374
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:06,040
I have to be at work earlier tomorrow.

1375
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:06,730
明日 少し早めの出勤なんだ

1376
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,820
The Manager wants to talk to me about something.

1377
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:09,740
支店長から
話があるって呼び出されてね

1378
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:13,240
あッ なんか嬉しそう

1379
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,740
You look kinda happy.

1380
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:16,680
Could it be about a promotion?

1381
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:17,410
それって もしかして栄転の話？

1382
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,420
- Is it?
- I don't know yet.

1383
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:19,710
そうなの？
まだ分からないよ

1384
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:22,500
According to rumors, it could be.

1385
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:23,250
そうじゃないかって
社内じゃ噂になってるけど

1386
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:26,400
What's this very picture of a happy story.

1387
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:27,070
何 その絵に描いたような
幸せストーリー

1388
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,980
It's not for sure yet.

1389
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:29,740
いや まだ決まってないから

1390
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:33,680
あッ 何か
うらやましすぎて鼻血出そう

1391
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,920
I'm so envious I feel a nosebleed coming.

1392
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:35,780
Excuse me while I use your bathroom.

1393
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,280
ちょっとトイレ借りま～す

1394
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,380
I hope the rumor's true.

1395
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,880
ほんとに そうだといいわね

1396
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:45,910
I'm sure it is.

1397
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:46,410
きっとそうよ

1398
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:49,210
You've been working hard
ever since you came here.

1399
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:49,710
あなた こっちに来て
ずっと頑張ってたもの

1400
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:53,510
I owe it all to your support.

1401
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:54,010
由紀子が支えてくれたおかげだ

1402
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:59,980
I have to make up for
the time I lost when I was sick.

1403
00:46:56,380 --> 00:47:00,480
病気で遅れた分を
早く取り返さないとな

1404
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:44,980
I just arrived now.

1405
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:45,730
≪(浅野)今ちょうど
こっちに着いたところだ ああ

1406
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:49,220
心配ないと言ってるだろ
ちょっと疲れてるだけだよ

1407
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:48,720
I told you not to worry.
I'm just a little tired.

1408
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,400
Are Saori and Reo already...

1409
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:51,900
佐緒里と怜央はもう…➡

1410
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,960
Sorry, I'll call you back.

1411
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,900
すまん またかける

1412
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:02,520
What brings you here at this hour?

1413
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:06,090
どうしました？ こんな時間に
部下の手柄は上司のもの

1414
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:05,460
The boss takes credit
for his subordinate's good deed.

1415
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:08,860
The subordinate takes
responsibility for his boss's blunder.

1416
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:09,560
上司の失敗は部下の責任

1417
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:11,060
When I first joined the bank, 

1418
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,560
私が入行した当時

1419
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:14,230
I heard cynical remarks like that all the time.

1420
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:14,730
そんな皮肉を よく聞かされました

1421
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:17,400
- What are you trying to say?
- Manager Asano.

1422
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:17,900
何が言いたいんですか？
浅野支店長

1423
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:22,240
What are your thoughts on who should be
responsible for this loan blunder?

1424
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:22,740
今回の融資失敗の責任の所在
どうお考えですか？

1425
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,600
You're quite abrupt.

1426
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:25,100
唐突ですね

1427
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,570
Naturally, everyone who was involved, 
including me...

1428
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:28,070
むろん私をはじめ
関わった行員全員が

1429
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:30,900
I'm wholly responsible.

1430
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:31,230
全て 私一人の責任だと

1431
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,380
That's what I hear you've been telling

1432
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:33,550
あなたが 大和田常務をはじめ

1433
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,900
Director Owada and other Headquarters personnel.

1434
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:36,400
本部の人間に
そう言ってると聞きました

1435
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:38,780
That's some kind of a mistake.
Who's saying that?

1436
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,420
何かの間違いじゃ…
誰がそんなことを？

1437
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,920
I confirmed it with my peers.

1438
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:42,420
同期の連中に確認しました

1439
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,060
Am I

1440
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,090
私は

1441
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,190
a lizard's tail?

1442
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,690
トカゲの尻尾でしょうか？

1443
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:54,870
Please answer me.

1444
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:55,370
答えてください

1445
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,580
I'm sorry, Hanzawa-kun.

1446
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:03,080
すまん 半沢君

1447
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:07,080
But someone has to take the blame for this.

1448
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:07,580
今回の件は 誰かが
泥をかぶらなければならない

1449
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,700
But if I do, 

1450
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:09,620
しかし私がそうなれば

1451
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:12,620
the entire Osaka Nishi Branch will be scarred.

1452
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:13,120
大阪西支店全体が
傷を負うことになってしまう

1453
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,910
Hanzawa-kun.
Please endure it now for everyone's sake.

1454
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:17,410
半沢君 ここは
みんなのために耐えてくれ

1455
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:21,730
You also said it was for everyone's sake
when you ordered me to get the loan approved.

1456
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:22,230
私に融資を通せと命じたときも
みんなのためと言いましたね

1457
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:24,730
Are you telling me now to
get shipped out for everyone's sake?

1458
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:25,230
今度は みんなのために
私に出向しろと？

1459
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:28,720
I promise I'll bring you back in 2 years.
You can rest assured.

1460
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:29,220
２年したら必ず戻す 安心していい

1461
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,750
I've been in the personnel field
ever since I joined the bank.

1462
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:32,250
私は入行以来
人事畑を歩いてきた人間だ

1463
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:35,350
I'm sure I can help you.
Trust me. Please.

1464
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:35,850
必ず力になれる 信じてくれ 頼む

1465
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:41,900
"I will take all responsibility."

1466
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:42,400
｢私が全責任を持つ｣

1467
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:44,920
I heard you clearly say that.

1468
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,420
あのとき あなたは
確かにそう言ったはずだ

1469
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:47,520
Was that a lie?

1470
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:48,020
あれは嘘だったんですか？

1471
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:53,100
I don't trust

1472
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:53,740
あなたの言葉は

1473
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,540
anything you say.

1474
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:56,040
信用できません

1475
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:09,870
What do you want me to do then?

1476
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:10,370
だったら どうしろと言うんだね？

1477
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:14,080
You've been talking all this time
like you did no wrong, but

1478
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:14,580
さっきから
偉そうなことを言ってるが

1479
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:18,250
the fact is, 
you couldn't spot the window dressing.

1480
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:18,750
しょせん君は
粉飾を見破れなかったじゃないか

1481
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:24,040
That's unmistakably
your responsibility as Loan Section Chief.

1482
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:23,850
それは 紛れもなく
融資課長としての君の責任だろ

1483
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:28,210
How dare you strike back at your superior
after causing a 500-million yen loss.

1484
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:28,710
５億もの損失を出しておいて
上司に刃向かうとは

1485
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:33,400
I'm the one who's inconvenienced.
Good bye.

1486
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:33,250
迷惑を被っているのは私のほうだ
失礼する！

1487
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:35,830
Fine.

1488
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:36,330
分かりました

1489
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:40,000
You'll be happy if I recover the 500 million, right?

1490
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:39,920
５億を取り戻せばいいんですね

1491
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:43,090
Please do so.

1492
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,590
ぜひ そうしてくれたまえ

1493
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:46,400
I'm looking forward to it, 
Chief Hanzawa.

1494
00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:46,900
期待しているよ 半沢融資課長

1495
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,750
If I succeed in getting it back, 

1496
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:50,250
もし取り戻すことができたら

1497
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:52,340
at that time, 

1498
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:52,350
そのときは 今回の件

1499
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:56,270
I expect you to apologize on your knees.

1500
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:56,770
土下座して わびてもらいます

1501
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,340
Is that a deal?

1502
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,020
よろしいですね

1503
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:05,230
If you can do such a thing.

1504
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:05,730
そんなことが できるものならな

1505
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:12,020
You're pathetic, Hanzawa.

1506
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,520
ぶざまだな 半沢

1507
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:26,900
The next day, Hanzawa, 
while looking for Higashida, 

1508
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:27,400
<翌日 東田の居場所を探す半沢は>

1509
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:29,370
decided to gamble on a ray of hope

1510
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,870
<いちるの望みをかけ>

1511
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:33,410
and paid a visit to Takeshita Kinzoku, 
a company that went bankrupt

1659
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:48,780
I said get out!

1660

とっとと帰らんかい！

1661

あなたが死んだところで

東田は 何の痛みも感じませんよ

1667
00:58:11,310 --> 00:58:14,680
I'll find that guy no matter what.

私は必ず あの男を見つけ出し

1669

I'll make him suffer more pain
than what you and I had to endure.

1670
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:20,220
あなたや私が味わった以上の
痛みを味わわせてやる

I believe in people's good will, but

人の善意は信じますが

Double payback.

それが私の流儀なんでね

どうでしたか？ 竹下金属は

<銀行にとって 国税局の査察ほど
やっかいなものはなかった>

<彼らは 予告もなく押しかけ>

1702

It's a waste of time.

<実際に調べているのは>

1718
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:38,740
is just one company or individual out of that pool.

<その中の たった一つの
会社や個人である>

- You can make copies over there.

いいから持ってきて

1723
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:47,000
It's too much trouble going back and forth
every time. Just bring it in.

1724
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,730
Hey, you guys...

1725
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:49,230
ちょっと あんたら…

1726
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:54,140
We will be happy to cooperate as long as
it doesn't interfere with our normal duties.

That's right.
You do have normal duties, don't you?

1729
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:58,700
そうね 通常業務があるものね

1730
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:07,660
Then let's bring down
the shutters, shall we?

1731
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:07,380

- Do you know something about him?

1734
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:14,080
He's loaned out to
the Taxation Bureau now, but

元は金融庁の監査官だった

previously, he was an auditor at
Financial Services Agency.

he was sent to the Taxation Bureau

01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:32,390
銀行を目の敵にしてるってわけか
しかし気にならないか？

1746

But isn't it odd?

1747
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:35,540
Look at the timing.
The accounting period just ended.

1748
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:36,230
このタイミングだよ
まだ決算期を終えたばかりだ

1749
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:40,730
In spite of that, they made a move this fast.
There must be a reason.

1750
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:41,230
にもかかわらず これだけ素早く
国税が動くのには理由があるはず

1751
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:42,750
For example, 

1752
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:43,250
例えば

1753
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:46,240
to investigate a company that went bankrupt.

1754

西大阪スチールか
まだ確証はありませんが

1757
01:01:49,090 --> 01:01:52,230
there's no way they'll tell us
the subject of their investigation.

1758
01:01:49,590 --> 01:01:52,730
あいつらは
調査対象を教えることはまずない

1759
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:55,640
Isn't there some way we can find out?

1760
01:01:52,730 --> 01:01:55,530
何とか確かめる方法は
ないですかね

それとも のぞきが趣味かしら？

Ohtsuka.

1796
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:28,930
- Did you erase all the data?
- Completely.

1797
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:29,430
ちゃんとデータは消した？
大丈夫です

1798
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:31,940
Okay. All right, then.

1799
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:31,750
そう ならいいの

1800
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:35,550
最近のコピー機は 本体に
データを記憶するものが多いから

1801
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:36,360
A lot of copiers these days
can save data internally.

1802
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:39,900
We have to take precautions.

1803
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:39,520
注意しないとね

1804
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:51,740
I bet those guys did this on purpose.

わざとやってんじゃねえだろうな

課長
松下さん お願いします

1808
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,020
I sure hope they didn't find it.

1809
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:58,050
(松下)バレてなきゃ いいけどな～

1810
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:07,580
It's still here. They didn't find it.

1811
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:08,080
あった バレてない

1812
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:10,100
よしッ

1813
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:11,920
Laptop.

is gone, as expected.

01:04:16,090 --> 01:04:18,460
やっぱ消されてるわ

1819
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:21,260
We just have to hope the data's still
on this external hard drive.

あとは この外付けのﾊｰﾄﾞﾃﾞｨｽｸに

It's here. It's up.

- There's a ray of hope now.

これで望みが出てきましたね

どういうことですか？
中西

1828
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:46,240
- What does this mean?
- Nakanishi.

1829
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:50,430
Normally, Taxation Bureau won't bother
investigating a bankrupt company with debts.

1830
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:50,930
普通は 借金残して
潰れた会社なんか国税は調べない

1831
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:53,980
Investigating on a large scale like this means...

1832
01:04:50,930 --> 01:04:55,100
これだけ大掛かりに調べるのは…
そうか

1833
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,080
- I see.
- It means there may be

まだどこかに 取れるだけの金が
残っているかも… ってことだ

1835
01:04:56,100 --> 01:05:00,080
enough money left somewhere
that we can get a hold of.

I can never beat you.

1843
01:05:34,590 --> 01:05:37,960
相変わらず
お前には歯がたたないな 俺は

1844
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:40,090
It was a good match today.

1845
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:40,590
いや 今日はいい勝負だったよ

1846
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:43,980
But it's unusual for you to call me out.

1847
01:05:40,590 --> 01:05:44,090
だけど珍しいな お前のほうから
ここに誘うなんて

1848
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:47,900
Did something happen?

1849
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:48,400
何かあったのか？

1850
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:55,020
Naw. I just thought you might be feeling down.

1851
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:55,260
いや お前が
へこんでるんじゃねえかと思って

1852
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:58,340
I figured I'd get you fired up a little.

1853
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:57,760
ちょっと気合い入れてやろうと
思ったんだよ

1854
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:00,400
I see.

1855
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:00,900
そうか

1856
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:03,360
Thanks to you, I feel energized.

1857
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:03,580
おかげで元気が出たよ

1858
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:05,240
Thanks.

1859
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:06,080
ありがとうな
おう

1860
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:09,180
Actually, I just happened to
overhear something.

1861
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:09,570
実は ちょっと小耳に挟んだことが
あるんだが

うんッ？
西大阪スチールのことで

In regards to Nishi Osaka Steel.

01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:28,700
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

《間違いないのか？》
《ああ》

1866

frequent Nishi Osaka Steel

That guy's sure to be there.

I need your signature immediately.

Can you bring it here?

捜しましたよ 波野さん

1883
01:07:22,910 --> 01:07:28,600
I swear, I knew nothing about window dressing.
Higashida did it all.

1884
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:28,750
粉飾なんて ほんとに知らなかった
全部 東田がやったことです

1885
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:31,250
There's no way that you, 
Nishi Osaka Steel's financial watchdog, 

1886
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:31,750
西大阪スチールの
金庫番だったあなたが

1887
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:33,550
wouldn't know, is there?

1888
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:34,050
知らないはず ないでしょう

1889
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:38,160
May I see the off balance sheet?

1890
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:38,460
裏帳簿を出してもらえますか？

1891

- I don't have it. I got rid of everything.
- No, I'm sure you still have it.

1892
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:42,100
ありませんよ 全部処分しました
いいや あるはずです

1893
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:46,420
東田社長は いつあなたに全責任を
なすりつけるか分からない

1894
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:46,220
You never know when President Higashida
might turn the table on you.

1895
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:48,260
He's that kind of a guy.

1896
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:48,570
あいつは そういう男です

1897
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:50,260
To use it as a trump card if that happened, 

1898
01:07:48,570 --> 01:07:50,760
そのための切り札として

1899
01:07:50,260 --> 01:07:54,600
you kept the real books with you at all times.

1900
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:54,760
あなたは常に 本物の帳簿を
手元に置いているはずだ

1901
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:57,360
Please show me the books from the past 3 years.

1902
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:57,860
３年分 出してください

1903
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:08,910
There, are you happy now?
Take this and leave.

1904
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:09,410
これで満足だろ
さっさと帰ってくれ

1905
01:08:08,910 --> 01:08:11,410
Where's Higashida now?

1906
01:08:09,410 --> 01:08:11,910
東田は今 どこにいるんですか？

1907
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:14,500
I don't know. We haven't been in contact
after the company went bankrupt.

1908
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:14,750
さあ
倒産以来 連絡取ってませんから

1909
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:16,250
I'll change my question then.

1910
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:16,750
では質問を変えます

1911
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:19,900
Where is Higashida hiding his money?

1912
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:20,400
東田は どこに
金を隠し持ってるんですか？

1913
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:22,100
No way. Why would...

1914
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:22,400
まさか 何でそんなこと…

1915
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:26,200
Window dressing wasn't the only thing
you folks were doing. Weren't you also evading taxes?

1916
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:26,590
あなた達は 粉飾だけじゃなく
脱税もしていたんじゃ？

1917
01:08:26,590 --> 01:08:28,580
ちょっ… ちょっと

1918
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:32,080
If that's the case, there's a good chance
there's money hidden somewhere.

1919
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:32,580
だとしたら どこかに金を
隠し持っていても不思議じゃない

1920
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:35,200
Tell me the whole truth.

1921
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:35,700
もう全部
ほんとのこと話してください

1922
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:39,800
- How much and where is the money?
- I really don't know.

1923
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:39,900
金は どこに いくらあるんですか
知らないんだ 本当に

1924
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:43,490
もう 勘弁してくれ！

1925
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,180
Come on, give me a break!

1926
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:47,020
I just want to forget about it~.

1927
01:08:43,490 --> 01:08:46,290
俺はもう忘れたいんだよ～

1928
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:53,980
Quit saying whatever suits you.

1929
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:54,090
都合のいいこと
言ってんじゃねえぞ

1930
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:58,100
Because of you guys, do you realize
how many people were driven to the brink...

1931
01:08:54,090 --> 01:08:58,440
あんた達のせいで どれだけの
人間が追い詰められたか…

1932
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:02,700
I won't let you forget that easily!

1933
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:02,940
あんた一人にだけ そう簡単に
忘れられてたまるか！

1934
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:09,020
Tokyo Chuo Bank is planning to file
a damage report with the police.

1935
01:09:04,430 --> 01:09:09,270
東京中央銀行は 今度の件で
警察に被害届を出すつもりです

1936
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:11,680
- Police?
- If that happens, it won't be just Higashida.

1937
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:11,920
警察？
そうなれば 東田だけじゃない

1938
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:14,070
You're an accomplice too.

1939
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:14,570
あんたも共犯だ

1940
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:18,240
I swear, I don't know anything
in regards to the money.

1941
01:09:14,570 --> 01:09:18,610
ほんと 金のことは
何にも知らないんだ

1942
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:19,740
In regards to the money?

1943
01:09:18,610 --> 01:09:20,610
金のことは？

1944
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:26,750
Higashida's probably

1945
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:27,250
東田は たぶん

1946
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:30,750
未樹っていう女のところに…

1947
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:30,250
with a woman called Miki...

1948
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:37,150
Room 806 of a luxury condo in Maiko.

1949
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:37,650
舞子の高層マンションの806号室

1950
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:39,600
That's all I know...

1951
01:09:37,650 --> 01:09:40,100
私はもう それしか…

1952
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:43,400
ああ～ッ

1953
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:47,820
Namino-san. Medication?

1954

波野さんッ 薬？ 薬ね

1955

What did you do to him?
He's prone to attacks from his chronic disease.

1956
01:09:48,670 --> 01:09:52,270
あんた何したの？
波野さんは持病の発作があんのよ

1957
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:06,590
Listen, Naoki.

I didn't want to give you

Is that true?

分かっているとは思いますが
今日来ていただいたのは

2203

is in regards to the loan

According to your report, 
the loss of 500 million was due to

同社の決算書が
粉飾されていたことだ とある➡

2208

the fact that the company's financial
statements were being window dressed.

However, in our opinion,

それが見過ごされてしまった
ことの方が➡

the fact that the window dressing
was overlooked in the early stage

I was told it was an urgent request.
Therefore, I did not have enough time to examine it.

01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:27,380
for this whole matter.

2262
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:27,420
納得いたしかねます

2263
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:32,880
In regards to that request for approval, 
I was merely following my superior's order.

2264
01:26:28,470 --> 01:26:32,970
あの稟議に関しては
全て上の指示に従ったまでのこと

2265
01:26:32,900 --> 01:26:35,700
The document was snatched away
prior to my examination, and

2266
01:26:32,970 --> 01:26:36,030
私が審査をする前に
稟議書は取り上げられ

2267
01:26:35,740 --> 01:26:37,440
was sent on to Headquarters.

2268
01:26:36,030 --> 01:26:37,940
本部へと送られました

2269
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:42,130
At that time, 
Manager Asano clearly stated that

2270
01:26:37,940 --> 01:26:42,630
そのとき 浅野支店長は
確かに こうおっしゃいました

2271
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:44,920
he will take all the responsibility.

2272
01:26:42,630 --> 01:26:45,120
｢自分が全責任を取る｣と

2273
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:47,760
Are you shifting your responsibility
to your manager?

2274
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:48,040
自分の責任を支店長に
なすりつけるのか？➡

2275
01:26:47,860 --> 01:26:51,460
We talked to both Manager Asano and
Assistant Manager Ejima beforehand.

2276
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:51,460
前もって話を聞いた浅野支店長も
江島副支店長も➡

2277
01:26:51,460 --> 01:26:54,460
言った覚えはないと答えてるぞ

2278
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:54,340
Both of them said that was never said.

2279
01:26:54,340 --> 01:26:59,940
I'm simply telling you the truth.
That was the Manager's agenda item.

2280
01:26:54,460 --> 01:27:00,050
私は事実を申し上げてるだけです
あれは支店長マターの案件でした

2281
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:02,780
You're aware of that too, aren't you?

2282
01:27:00,050 --> 01:27:02,950
あなた方も そのことは
ご存じなんじゃ？

2283
01:27:02,820 --> 01:27:05,860
- What does that mean?
- There's no deep meaning.

2284
01:27:02,950 --> 01:27:06,340
どういう意味だねッ
深い意味などありませんよ

2285
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:11,000
Manager Asano's former subordinates, 
Sadaoka-san, Ogiso-san.

2286
01:27:06,340 --> 01:27:10,780
浅野支店長の元部下だった
定岡さん 小木曽さん

2287
01:27:10,780 --> 01:27:13,960
君には反省の色が
まるでないようだな

2288
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:13,780
You seem to feel no remorse whatsoever.

2289
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:17,140
If being amiable can bring back 500 million, 
I will do so, but

2290
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:17,470
しおらしくして５億が戻るなら
そうしますが

2291
01:27:17,180 --> 01:27:20,020
that's a waste of time.

2292
01:27:17,470 --> 01:27:20,120
そんなことをしても 時間のムダだ

2293
01:27:20,060 --> 01:27:23,020
Can you please quickly
end this senseless farce?

2294
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:23,460
くだらない茶番は
終わらせてもらえませんか？

2295
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:24,760
Watch your mouth!

2296
01:27:23,460 --> 01:27:28,390
君は旧産業中央銀行出身の我々に
泥を塗ったんだぞ！

2297
01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:28,080
You brought disgrace those of us
from the old Sangyo Chuo Bank!

2298
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:30,320
The old Sangyo Chuo.

2299
01:27:28,390 --> 01:27:30,500
旧産業中央

2300
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:32,900
The old Tokyo Daiichi.

2301
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:32,600
旧東京第一

2302
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:36,790
That is of no concern to me!

2303
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:37,290
そんなものは
知ったことではありません！

2304
01:27:37,290 --> 01:27:41,620
≪(小木曽)いいかげんにしろッ
粉飾を見破れなかったのは

2305
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:41,460
Enough is enough! No matter what, 
you, the Loan Section Chief, is

2306
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:45,460
- responsible for overlooking the window dressing!
- Yes, absolutely.

2307
01:27:41,620 --> 01:27:45,500
融資課長である君の責任だぞ！
ええ そのとおり

2308
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:50,820
But by the same token, Headquarters'
Examining Division is just as guilty.

2309
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:50,800
だが それを言うなら あなた達
本部の審査部も同罪ですよ

2310
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:54,340
何だと
あなた方にも同じ資料を提出した

2311
01:27:50,860 --> 01:27:54,340
- Say what?
- I provided the same material to you.

2312
01:27:54,340 --> 01:27:57,100
The Loan Department spent
3 days approving the loan, 

2313
01:27:54,340 --> 01:27:58,810
融資部は３日もかけて認可したが
粉飾を見抜けなかった

2314
01:27:57,100 --> 01:27:58,780
yet they couldn't spot the window dressing.

2315
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:01,380
That's because you coerced them into it!

2316
01:27:58,810 --> 01:28:01,460
お前がゴリ押ししたからだ！

2317
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:04,860
Will the Loan Department approve
the loan if they're coerced?

2318
01:28:01,460 --> 01:28:04,960
ゴリ押しされれば
稟議を認可するんですか？

2319
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:07,420
In that the case, I'll coerce them
every time from now on.

2320
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:07,620
なら これからは
毎回ゴリ押ししますよ

2321
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:10,640
If that's all it takes to get approval, 
it makes life a lot easier for us.

2322
01:28:07,620 --> 01:28:11,140
それで通るなら
こんなに楽なことはない

2323
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:13,520
Our policy is to let the field handle its business.

2324
01:28:11,140 --> 01:28:13,690
当行は現場主義だ

2325
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:16,140
We respect the field's decision above all else.

2326
01:28:13,690 --> 01:28:16,130
現場の判断が 最も尊重される

2327
01:28:16,130 --> 01:28:20,150
つまりそれは 最終責任が
現場にあることを意味している

2328
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:20,020
That means that the final responsibility
lies with the field office.

2329
01:28:20,020 --> 01:28:23,260
If that's the case, why do we need you?

2330
01:28:20,150 --> 01:28:23,250
だったら あんた達は
何のためにいる？

2331
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:28,620
What's the use in having a Headquarters
Examination Division if it can't be held accountable?

2332
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:28,890
責任が取れない本部審査に
何の意味がある？

2333
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:32,760
A Loan Department like that is worthless.
Do away with it!

2334
01:28:28,890 --> 01:28:33,060
そんな融資部なら必要ない
やめてしまえ！

2335
01:28:32,820 --> 01:28:37,480
Don't be writing everything
that suits you, record keeper!

2336
01:28:33,060 --> 01:28:37,630
さっきから都合のいいことばかり
書いてんじゃねえぞ 記録！

2337
01:28:37,580 --> 01:28:39,930
Take down what I'm about to say.

2338
01:28:37,630 --> 01:28:40,430
今から言うことを書き留めとけ

2339
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:45,020
I'll recover the 500 million no matter what.

2340
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:45,150
私は必ず５億を回収する

2341
01:28:45,140 --> 01:28:48,320
I'd appreciate it if you don't
ever interfere again.

2342
01:28:45,150 --> 01:28:47,950
二度と邪魔しないでいただきたい

2343
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:07,400
Hey, you sure talked big, but
can you really collect the 500 million?

2344
01:29:03,970 --> 01:29:07,630
お前 あんなこと言って
ほんとに５億回収できんのかよ

2345
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:09,900
You made an enemy of your manager.

2346

2347

01:31:21,460 --> 01:31:24,460
頭取は どうご覧になりますか？

2411
01:31:21,580 --> 01:31:24,300
What is your opinion, Chairman?

2412
01:31:24,460 --> 01:31:29,120
彼が ５億以上の価値が
あるかどうか

2413
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:28,960
Is he worth more than 500 million?

2414
01:31:28,980 --> 01:31:32,880
Owada-kun, people's value can't be monetized.

2415
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:33,190
大和田君
人の価値は 金には代えられない

2416
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:35,000
That's what I believe.

2417
01:31:33,190 --> 01:31:35,190
私は そう思ってる

2418
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:41,300
Us bankers are given the power to
move enormous amounts of money.

2419
01:31:36,140 --> 01:31:41,560
我々銀行員は ばく大な金を
動かす力を与えられている

2420
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:44,840
If we feel so inclined, 
it's a power that can

2421
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:44,970
その気になれば 人ひとりの人生を

2422
01:31:44,860 --> 01:31:48,540
make or break one person's life.

2423
01:31:44,970 --> 01:31:48,470
生かすことも殺すことも
できてしまう力だ

2424
01:31:48,470 --> 01:31:52,790
だからこそ
銀行員が見るべきものは

2425
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:52,920
That's precisely why bankers should be looking at

2426
01:31:52,790 --> 01:31:55,890
金ではなく人である と

2427
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:56,120
people, not money.

2428
01:31:57,720 --> 01:31:59,800
That's what I believe.

2429
01:31:57,780 --> 01:31:59,780
私は そう思ってる
